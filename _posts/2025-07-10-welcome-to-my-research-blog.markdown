# Welcome to My Research Blog

Hello and welcome! I'm Dr. Brian Rivera, and I'm excited to launch this research blog as a space to share insights, discoveries, and reflections from my work in numerical cognition and educational neuroscience.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog will serve as a window into my research world, where I'll share:

**Research Updates**: Behind-the-scenes looks at my current projects, including the multivariate EEG decoding of fraction processing and my equation-graph semantic violation experiments.

**Conference Insights**: Reflections and key takeaways from academic conferences, workshops, and collaborative meetings in the mathematical cognition community.

**Teaching Moments**: Observations from the classroom that connect neuroscience research to real-world learning, especially around mathematical concepts that challenge students.

**Course Materials & Reflections**: Updates about my current courses and resources that might help students connect psychology and neuroscience to everyday learning.

**Methodological Musings**: Thoughts on EEG/ERP techniques, experimental design, and the evolving landscape of educational neuroscience research methods—explained in ways that don't require a PhD to understand.

**Interdisciplinary Connections**: How findings in numerical cognition relate to broader questions in psychology, education, and cognitive science.

## Why Blog About Research?

I'm doing this because I think about math and the brain all day, and I want to share what I'm learning.

If you're here, you probably care about learning, teaching, or how the mind works. Maybe you're a researcher working on similar problems, a teacher wondering if neuroscience has anything useful to offer, a student in one of my classes looking for additional resources, or someone curious about mathematical thinking or the brain in general.

I'll write about studies I'm running, papers I'm reading, and ideas I'm wrestling with. Writing forces me to think more clearly and explain things in ways people can actually understand—which pushes me but also means I'm likely to make mistakes. I'll try to be clear about what we actually know versus what we're still figuring out. If you catch errors or see things differently, tell me.

## Looking Ahead

I'm currently deep in analysis of EEG data exploring how the brain represents fraction magnitude—work that could reshape how we understand mathematical learning difficulties. I'll be sharing updates on this project and others as they develop.

## Join the Conversation

Research is fundamentally collaborative. While this blog represents my perspective and work, I encourage readers to engage, question, and share their own insights. Whether you're a researcher, educator, current or former student, or simply someone fascinated by how the mind works, your voice adds value to the conversation.

Thank you
