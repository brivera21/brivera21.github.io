# Welcome to My Research Blog

Hello and welcome! I'm Dr. Brian Rivera, and I'm excited to launch this research blog as a space to share insights, discoveries, and reflections from my work in numerical cognition and educational neuroscience.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog will serve as a window into my research world, where I'll share:

**Research Updates**: Behind-the-scenes looks at my current projects, including the multivariate EEG decoding of fraction processing and my equation-graph semantic violation experiments.

**Conference Insights**: Reflections and key takeaways from academic conferences, workshops, and collaborative meetings in the mathematical cognition community.

**Teaching Moments**: Observations from the classroom that connect neuroscience research to real-world learning, especially around mathematical concepts that challenge students.

**Methodological Musings**: Thoughts on EEG/ERP techniques, experimental design, and the evolving landscape of educational neuroscience research methods.

**Interdisciplinary Connections**: How findings in numerical cognition relate to broader questions in psychology, education, and cognitive science.

## Why Blog About Research?

As someone who bridges neuroscience, psychology, and education, I believe in the power of making research accessible and fostering dialogue. Science advances through conversation, and I hope this blog becomes a place where:

- Fellow researchers can engage with ideas and share perspectives
- Educators can discover how brain research might inform their practice
- Students can see the human side of scientific inquiry
- Anyone curious about how we learn mathematics can find insights

## Looking Ahead

I'm currently deep in analysis of EEG data exploring how the brain represents fraction magnitudeâ€”work that could reshape how we understand mathematical learning difficulties. I'll be sharing updates on this project and others as they develop.

I'm also preparing for several upcoming conferences where I'll present new findings on semantic processing in mathematical contexts. Expect posts reflecting on those experiences and the conversations they spark.

## Join the Conversation

Research is fundamentally collaborative. While this blog represents my perspective and work, I encourage readers to engage, question, and share their own insights. Whether you're a researcher, educator, student, or simply someone fascinated by how the mind works, your voice adds value to the conversation.

Thank you for joining me on this journey of discovery. Here's to understanding the beautiful complexity of how brains learn math!
