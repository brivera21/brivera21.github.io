# Research Overview

My research investigates the neural mechanisms underlying mathematical thinking, with particular emphasis on numerical cognition and fraction processing. I use advanced electrophysiological methods (EEG/ERP) combined with behavioral experiments to understand how the brain processes mathematical information.

## Research Questions

How does the brain represent and process numerical information? What neural mechanisms underlie mathematical learning difficulties? How can neuroscientific findings inform mathematics education?

## Current Projects

### Multivariate EEG Decoding of Fraction Processing

Understanding how people access fraction magnitude is crucial for mathematics education, as fractions represent a fundamental gateway to higher-level mathematical concepts. This project applies cross-generalization decoding techniques to test whether neural representations of fraction magnitude are abstract or tied to specific surface forms. We examine whether brain patterns learned from one fraction notation (e.g., 2/4) can successfully predict equivalent fractions in different forms (e.g., 3/6, 4/8).

### Equation-Graph Semantic Violation Experiment

This research investigates whether mathematical equation-graph mismatches trigger the same N400 neural signature (~400ms post-stimulus) as traditional language-based semantic violations. Participants view linear equations followed by coordinate graphs and judge whether they match. This extends N400 studies from linguistic to mathematical domains, testing whether semantic processing mechanisms are domain-general or domain-specific.

## Research Methods

- **EEG/ERP**: Recording brain electrical activity during mathematical tasks
