## Teaching Philosophy

I am driven by the practical implications of psychology and neuroscience, which motivates me to share my enthusiasm with students. I leverage my passion for these subjects as the foundation for communicating course content, whether in introductory or advanced research methods courses.

I strive to integrate examples that resonate with students' lives to enhance the relevance of the content and by connecting psychological concepts to students' daily experiences. When possible, I use hands-on demonstrations—such as connecting students to mobile EEG devices to illustrate brain electrical activity—to spark curiosity and deepen engagement.

## Teaching Approach

- **Individualized feedback** to support student growth and monitor comprehension
- **Iterative presentation process** to build confidence and reduce anxiety
- **Real-world applications** connecting neuroscience concepts to everyday life
- **Inclusive learning environment** where every student can feel valued and supported
- **Evidence-based practices** grounded in the psychology of learning
