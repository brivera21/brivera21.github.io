## Teaching Philosophy

My passion for teaching psychology and neuroscience comes from watching students discover how these ideas can connect to and illuminate their everyday experiences. I leverage this passion as the foundation for communicating course content, whether in introductory cpurses or advanced research methods seminars.

I strive to integrate examples that resonate with students' lives to enhance the relevance of the content and by connecting psychological concepts to students' daily experiences. When possible, I use hands-on demonstrations—such as connecting students to mobile EEG devices to illustrate brain electrical activity—to spark curiosity and deepen engagement. Influenced by the liberal arts in my own education, I embrace an interdisciplinary approach that embeds psychology and neuroscience within broader contexts like evolution and chemistry but also connect them to history and philosophy.

## Teaching Approach

- **Individualized feedback** to support student growth and monitor comprehension
- **Iterative presentation process** to build confidence and reduce anxiety
- **Real-world applications** connecting neuroscience concepts to everyday life
- **Inclusive learning environment** where every student can feel valued and supported
- **Evidence-based practices** grounded in the psychology of learning
