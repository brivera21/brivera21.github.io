Welcome! An Introduction to Research in the [Your Last Name] Lab
Hello and welcome! We're excited you're interested in joining our research lab. This guide is designed to give you a clear picture of what we do, what the research process looks like, and what you can expect as a member of our team.

No prior research experience is necessary to join. Our main goal is to provide a comprehensive training experience. We value curiosity and a willingness to learn above all else.

Our Lab's Focus: Numerical Cognition & EEG
Our lab investigates Numerical Cognition. We explore the fascinating questions of how people learn and think about numbers.

Big Questions: What happens in the brain when we solve an addition problem, reason about fractions, or learn multiplication?

Primary Tool: We use Electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive technique that measures electrical activity in the brain. This allows us to see what's happening in real-time as someone processes numerical information.

Even if numerical cognition isn't your primary interest, the skills you learn here—like using EEG, designing experiments, and analyzing data—are valuable and transferable across many areas of psychology and neuroscience.

The Research Journey: From Idea to Discovery
A single experiment can be a year-long process. As a lab member, you will have the opportunity to participate in every stage. We want everyone to understand the full lifecycle of a research project.

1. Reading the Literature & Journal Club

What it is: We start by reading scientific papers to understand what other researchers have discovered. These articles can be dense and challenging at first, but you'll quickly get the hang of it.

Journal Club: We will meet regularly (e.g., every two weeks) to discuss a specific paper as a group. This is a chance to practice critically evaluating research methods, results, and conclusions.

2. Designing Experiments

What it is: This is the technical side of research. We use specialized hardware (the EEG system, computers, monitors) and software to build the tasks that participants will complete.

Your Role: You’ll get hands-on experience with the equipment and can learn how to program an experiment if that interests you.

3. Collecting Data

What it is: This is where we bring in participants (usually other students) to run the experiment.

Your Role: You will be trained to:

Communicate with and schedule participants.

Explain the study and guide them through the consent process.

Fit the EEG cap and ensure we are recording high-quality data.

Troubleshoot technical issues that arise.

Run the experiment and ensure the participant has a positive experience.

4. Analyzing the Data

What it is: Raw EEG data is messy. It needs to be carefully cleaned, organized, and processed before we can analyze it.

Your Role: You will learn how to use specialized software and data "pipelines" (step-by-step procedures) to prepare the data for statistical analysis.

5. Disseminating the Results

What it is: The final goal of research is to share what we've learned with the scientific community.

Your Role: After gaining experience, you may have the opportunity to analyze a piece of the data for a poster presentation at a conference or contribute to a research paper.

Your Role & Our Expectations
Commitment: For this semester, positions are on a volunteer basis. We are flexible and will work with your academic schedule. If you can commit 4-5 hours a week, we will find meaningful work for you to do.

Reliability: While we are flexible, we depend on you. If you sign up for a time slot, the expectation is that you will be there and engaged. Your reliability is crucial to the lab's success.

Independence & Problem-Solving: I will be heavily involved in your initial training. However, the goal is for you to become a self-sufficient researcher. A large part of research is learning to troubleshoot problems independently. Don't worry—you will be trained and supported, but we want you to develop confidence in your own abilities.

Growth & Mentorship: As you become more experienced, you will have the opportunity to help train new students who join the lab after you. This is a great way to develop leadership skills.

Lab Culture & Communication
Our lab is a collaborative and informal environment. You don't need to write formal emails for simple questions.

Communication Tool: We will use a group chat (e.g., Google Chat, Slack) for quick, informal updates, questions, and scheduling.

My Role: Think of me as your advisor and mentor. My goal is to train you and help you succeed. I want you to feel comfortable asking questions freely.

A Realistic Note on Research
Sometimes, the day-to-day reality of research isn't as glamorous as it first appears. You might find that programming is tedious, data cleaning is repetitive, or that the "perfect" brain picture is the result of many complex and sometimes arbitrary decisions. This is a normal part of the process! Learning to navigate these challenges is one of the most valuable lessons of being a researcher.

Next Steps
If this guide excites you and you're ready to learn, please let me know. We will be holding a group meeting for all interested students soon to discuss our first steps.

We look forward to working with you!
