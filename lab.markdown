# Numerical Cognition Lab

Welcome to the Numerical Cognition Lab at St. Olaf College, where we investigate how the brain processes mathematical information.

## Research Focus

Our lab uses EEG and behavioral methods to study numerical cognition, with particular emphasis on fraction processing and mathematical thinking.

## Methods

- EEG (Electroencephalography)
- Event-related potentials (ERP)
- Behavioral experiments
- Multivariate pattern analysis

## Research Opportunities

We welcome undergraduate students interested in gaining research experience in cognitive neuroscience and numerical cognition.
