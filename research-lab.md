# Rivera Lab: Numerical Cognition Research
*Understanding How the Brain Processes Mathematical Information*

---

## Research Focus

Our lab investigates **numerical cognition** â€“ the fascinating questions of how people learn and think about numbers and mathematical concepts. What happens in the brain when we solve an addition problem, reason about fractions, or learn multiplication? We use advanced neuroscientific methods including **EEG/ERP**, **fMRI**, and behavioral studies to understand how the brain processes numerical and mathematical information in real-time.

## Current Research Projects

### Multivariate EEG Decoding of Fraction Processing
This research investigates the neural mechanisms underlying fraction processing using advanced electrophysiological methods. Understanding how people access fraction magnitude is crucial for mathematics education, as fractions represent a fundamental gateway to higher-level mathematical concepts like algebra, yet remain one of the most challenging topics for students from elementary school through college.

Building on traditional ERP analysis, this project applies cross-generalization decoding techniques to test whether neural representations of fraction magnitude are abstract or tied to specific surface forms. This approach determines whether brain patterns learned from one fraction notation (e.g., 2/4) can successfully predict equivalent fractions in different forms (e.g., 3/6, 4/8).

### Equation-Graph Semantic Violation Experiment
This neuroscience research experiment studies semantic processing in the brain using ERP (Event-Related Potential) methodology, specifically investigating whether mathematical equation-graph mismatches trigger the same N400 neural signature (~400ms post-stimulus) as traditional language-based semantic violations.

Participants view linear equations (e.g., "y = 2x + 3") followed by coordinate graphs and judge whether they match, with 50% congruent pairs and 50% semantic violations involving wrong slopes, intercepts, or directions. This research extends N400 studies from linguistic to mathematical domains, testing whether semantic processing mechanisms are domain-general or domain-specific.

### The Research Journey
A single experiment can span up to a year. As a lab member, you'll participate in every stage of the research process:

**1. Literature Review & Journal Club** - Examine existing research through scientific papers and regular group discussions to develop critical evaluation skills.

**2. Experiment Design** - Gain hands-on experience with specialized EEG hardware and software, learning to program experimental tasks and work with technical equipment.

**3. Data Collection** - Direct participant interaction including recruitment, consent processes, EEG cap fitting, data quality monitoring, and experiment administration.

**4. Data Analysis** - Transform raw EEG data through cleaning, organization, and processing using specialized software and established analysis pipelines.

**5. Results Dissemination** - Share findings through conference presentations and research publications.

### Expectations & Commitment
- **Time Commitment:** 4-5 hours per week (volunteer basis, flexible scheduling)
- **Core Requirements:** Reliability, engagement, development of independent problem-solving skills, and mentorship of incoming members
- **Lab Culture:** Collaborative and informal environment with open communication

### Research Methods & Collaborations
We employ EEG/ERP for event-related potentials and multivariate decoding, fMRI for functional imaging, behavioral studies for cognitive assessments, and educational neuroscience approaches. We collaborate with researchers across psychology, education, and neuroscience to advance understanding of mathematical cognition and its applications to educational practice.
