# Welcome to the Rivera Lab

*An Introduction to Research in Numerical Cognition*

---

## About Our Research

Our lab investigates **numerical cognition** – the fascinating questions of how people learn and think about numbers. What happens in the brain when we solve an addition problem, reason about fractions, or learn multiplication?

We use **Electroencephalography (EEG)**, a non-invasive technique that measures electrical activity in the brain, allowing us to observe real-time neural processing as someone works with numerical information.

*No prior research experience is necessary.* We value curiosity and a willingness to learn above all else.

## The Research Journey

A single experiment spans approximately one year. As a lab member, you'll participate in every stage of the research process:

### 1. Literature Review & Journal Club
We begin by examining existing research through scientific papers and regular group discussions. These sessions develop critical evaluation skills for research methods, results, and conclusions.

### 2. Experiment Design
Hands-on experience with specialized EEG hardware and software. Learn to program experimental tasks and work with technical equipment.

### 3. Data Collection
Direct participant interaction including:
- Participant recruitment and scheduling
- Consent process guidance
- EEG cap fitting and data quality monitoring
- Technical troubleshooting
- Experiment administration

### 4. Data Analysis
Transform raw EEG data through cleaning, organization, and processing using specialized software and established analysis pipelines.

### 5. Results Dissemination
Share findings with the scientific community through conference presentations and research publications.
