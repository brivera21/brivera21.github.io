# Research Areas

My research focuses on numerical cognition, investigating how people process and understand mathematical concepts at the neural level. I use advanced electrophysiological methods to understand the brain mechanisms underlying mathematical thinking.

## Current Projects

### Multivariate EEG Decoding of Fraction Processing

This research investigates the neural mechanisms underlying fraction processing using advanced electrophysiological methods. Understanding how people access fraction magnitude is crucial for mathematics education, as fractions represent a fundamental gateway to higher-level mathematical concepts like algebra, yet remain one of the most challenging topics for students from elementary school through college.

Building on traditional ERP analysis, this project applies cross-generalization decoding techniques to test whether neural representations of fraction magnitude are abstract or tied to specific surface forms. This approach can determine whether brain patterns learned from one fraction notation (e.g., 2/4) can successfully predict equivalent fractions in different forms (e.g., 3/6, 4/8).

### Equation-Graph Semantic Violation Experiment

This neuroscience research experiment is designed to study semantic processing in the brain using ERP (Event-Related Potential) methodology, specifically investigating whether mathematical equation-graph mismatches trigger the same N400 neural signature (~400ms post-stimulus) as traditional language-based semantic violations.

Participants view linear equations (e.g., "y = 2x + 3") followed by coordinate graphs and judge whether they match, with 50% congruent pairs and 50% semantic violations involving wrong slopes, intercepts, or directions. This research extends N400 studies from linguistic to mathematical domains, testing whether semantic processing mechanisms are domain-general or domain-specific.

## Research Methods

- **EEG (Electroencephalography)**: Recording brain electrical activity to study cognitive processes
- **fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**: Investigating brain activation patterns
- **ERP (Event-Related Potentials)**: Examining time-locked brain responses to stimuli
- **Multivariate Pattern Analysis**: Advanced decoding techniques for neural data

## Implications

This research potentially informs our understanding of mathematical cognition and contributes novel paradigms for studying math-visual semantic integration, with implications for educational neuroscience and cognitive psychology.
