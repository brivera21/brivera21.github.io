## Research Background

Dr. Rivera earned his PhD in Educational Psychology from the University of Alabama, with a concentration in Educational Neuroscience, where he used EEG and fMRI to investigate the development of numerical cognition. He subsequently worked on the Baby's First Years study at the University of Nebraska Lincoln, researching how poverty affects brain development in early childhood.

This diverse background—spanning philosophical inquiry, neuroscientific research, educational psychology, and developmental studies—provides Dr. Rivera with a unique interdisciplinary perspective on learning and development. His research interests focus on numerical cognition, and he brings this integrative approach to his teaching, helping students understand the brain through multiple lenses.

## Personal Interests

When not in the classroom or lab, Dr. Rivera enjoys playing chess, watching movies, and spending time with his English Bulldog. As a former magician, he brings creativity and wonder to his academic work.

## Professional Philosophy

Dr. Rivera's primary goal is to serve as a hub of scientific and academic information for other academics and students. His main research area focuses on numerical cognition, and his professional brand can be described as wise, sharp, and simple. He is devoted to studying the fundamental questions of how the brain processes mathematical information.
