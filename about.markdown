Dr. Rivera is a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at St. Olaf College. Originally from northern Mexico, he moved with his family to Los Angeles where he attended high school before completing his undergraduate degree at Franklin and Marshall College. There, he competed in Track and Field while majoring in Scientific and Philosophical Studies of the Mind.

Dr. Rivera earned his PhD in Educational Psychology from the University of Alabama, with a concentration in Educational Neuroscience, where he used EEG and fMRI to investigate the development of numerical cognition. He subsequently worked on the Baby's First Years study at the University of Nebraska Lincoln, researching how poverty affects brain development in early childhood.

This diverse background—spanning philosophical inquiry, neuroscientific research, educational psychology, and developmental studies—provides Dr. Rivera with a unique interdisciplinary perspective on learning and development. His research interests focus on numerical cognition, and he brings this integrative approach to his teaching, helping students understand the brain through multiple lenses.

When not in the classroom or lab, Dr. Rivera enjoys playing chess, watching movies, and spending time with his English Bulldog. As a former magician, he brings creativity and wonder to his academic work.
