# Dr. Brian Rivera

**Visiting Assistant Professor**  
Department of Psychology, St. Olaf College

## Welcome

I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at St. Olaf College, specializing in numerical cognition research. Originally from northern Mexico, I moved with my family to Los Angeles where I attended high school before completing my undergraduate degree at Franklin and Marshall College, where I competed in Track and Field while majoring in Scientific and Philosophical Studies of the Mind.

## Research Focus

My work investigates the neural mechanisms underlying mathematical thinking, with particular emphasis on numerical cognition and fraction processing using EEG and fMRI methodologies. I earned my PhD in Educational Psychology from the University of Alabama, with a concentration in Educational Neuroscience, where I used EEG and fMRI to investigate the development of numerical cognition.

## Current Work

I am currently working on the Baby's First Years study at the University of Nebraska Lincoln, researching how poverty affects brain development in early childhood. This diverse background—spanning philosophical inquiry, neuroscientific research, educational psychology, and developmental studies—provides me with a unique interdisciplinary perspective on learning and development.
