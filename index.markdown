# Dr. Brian Rivera
**Visiting Assistant Professor | Department of Psychology | St. Olaf College**

Welcome to my academic website. I am a researcher specializing in **numerical cognition** and educational neuroscience, investigating how the brain processes mathematical concepts using EEG and fMRI methodologies.

## Research Focus
My work explores the neural mechanisms underlying fraction processing and mathematical learning, with applications to educational psychology and cognitive development.

## Current Projects
- **Multivariate EEG Decoding of Fraction Processing**: Investigating neural representations of fraction magnitude using advanced electrophysiological methods
- **Equation-Graph Semantic Violation Experiment**: Studying semantic processing in mathematical contexts using ERP methodology
